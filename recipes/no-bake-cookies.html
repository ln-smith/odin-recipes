        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) milk</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>TIP!</h4>
    <p>
        Before you get started making the cookies, I suggest getting all of your 
        ingredients ready and measuring them out. This will make the process go 
        much smoother, and the quicker you get everything combined after the 
        mixture has boiled the better the cookies will turn out.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>
            Combine the butter, sugar, milk, and unsweetened cocoa powder in a 
            large saucepan and heat over medium heat, making sure to stir often 
            until the butter is melted and everything is well combined. Bring 
            the mixture to a rolling boil and allow to boil for 60 seconds (make 
            sure to set a timer!) stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the heat, and stir in the peanut butter and vanilla 
            extract until fully combined. Stir in the oats and mix until all of 
            the oats are coated with the mixture and everything is well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets (I like 
            to use a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop). Allow to cool for 20 to 30 
            minutes, serve, and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cookies may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature 
            for up to one week.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the cookies have cooled completely, they can be stored in a 
            large freezer bag or freezer-friendly storage container in the 
            freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw the cookies to room temperature 
            before serving.
        </li>
        <li>
            I prefer to use whole milk in this recipe, but 2%, 1%, skim, or even 
            almond milk will work.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may used old-fashioned rolled oats in these cookies if you prefer 
            a chewier texture. Otherwise, I recommend using quick-cooking oats or 
            pulsing the old-fashioned rolled oats in a food processor 2 or 3 times 
            to break them down.
