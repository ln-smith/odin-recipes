        <li>For more flavor add in more dried herbs (or even triple the amount

            rosemary, marjoram, or Italian seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>Another option to add more flavor is to use a homemade chicken 
            stock or vegetable broth.
        </li>
        <li>Optionally you can finish servings with grated parmesan and a 
            splash of extra virgin olive oil.
